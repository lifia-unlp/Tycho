I adapt the interface of certain functions available in the Selenium web driver library to the interface used by the bots 
that participate in a session to perform automatic actions on the web application being tested.

I know how to navigate to a web page using the selenium web driver library.
I know how to click on an element of a web page using the selenium web driver library.
I know how to enter text in an input field of a web page using the selenium web driver library.
I know how to execute a JS script in the current web page using the selenium web driver library.


Public API and Key Messages

- clickOn:
- sendKeys:on:
- executeScript:
- (for bonus points) how to create instances.

   One simple example is simply gorgeous.
