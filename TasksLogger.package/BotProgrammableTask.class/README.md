I represent a bot task that simulates the execution of the associated protocol task running the programmed instructions.


I know the sequence of instructions I have to run to simulate the execution of the associated protocol task.
I can be edited by the designer of the experiment adding new instrucctions, removing instructions or changing its order of execution.
I know how to be executed by a bot that participates in a session.
